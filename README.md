# SandwitchClub_me
I have tried to apply all the required tasks from me in this project but until now I'm facing the issue that Json String Array Saved in the Strings file is not returning all the data despite me trying many solutions and many ways to retrieve the data from the json string. However, The code runs smoothly without crashing or errors and I think the logic of the code also is working alright except the missed data issue from the json String
The project Main Milestones to apply are as follows:

Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
